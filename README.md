Collections
===========

Collections is a MODX Revolution Extra that adds a custom `CollectionContainer` resource type that acts as a container of related resources. Children of a Collection are managed as regular Resources in a Children tab of the container resource and are hidden from the Resource Tree.

####Sub Collections
Just like the MODX Resource Tree itself, Collections supports nesting. You can create a Collection within another Collection. Sub Collections will be displayed in the resource tree.
